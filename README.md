# 3rd_Year_Modules_Selection
#### Oct 2017 â€“ Oct 2017

In my second year of university, we designed a web page for third year students enabling them to choose the modules they wanted to take by dragging and dropping the specific modules. Although this was unassessed project but we took it seriously and made great looking page. We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
